​Project Name: Ayoub Store (Digital Tailoring App)
​App Overview:
I want to build a professional custom tailoring app called "Ayoub Store." The app will allow users to order custom-made clothing (Shirts, Pants, Panjabi, Lungi, Frock, Kurta, and Nighty) from home. It must support three languages: English, Bengali, and Assamese.
​Key Pages and Features to Generate:
​Onboarding & Authentication: A clean login and signup screen with a language selection option (English, Bengali, Assamese).
​Home Screen: A category-based dashboard showing different clothing items (Men’s, Women’s, Kids') and a "New Order" button.
​AI Design Studio (Virtual Trial): A screen where users can upload their photos to see how different designs and colors look on them using AI.
​Smart Measurement Profile: A user profile section to save and update body measurements for one-click future orders.
​Real-time Order Tracking: A timeline view showing the status of the garment (Cutting, Stitching, Quality Check, or Ready for Delivery).
​Cloud Database: A secure backend integration to ensure no data is lost if the device is changed.
​Bottom Navigation Bar: Include 4 icons: Home, AI Studio, My Orders, and Profile.
​Design Style: Modern, minimalist, and user-friendly UI with a premium tailoring brand feel. Use a professional color palette (e.g., Deep Blue or Royal Gold accents).
